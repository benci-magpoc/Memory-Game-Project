## Description

This repository is for the Udacity Memory Game Project. The project is a static webpage coded in HTML/CSS and Javascript. It implements the basics of Javascript DOM manipulation. 

## How to Play

The game starts when the player clicks on any card; at the same time, the timer starts. The cards will flip, revealing the symbol which the player will have to find its pair. Once a pair is found, the cards will stay flipped throughout the game. The game will end once all cards are revealed (a total of eight pairs). The player is then asked if he/she wants to play again.
